		    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. <br>
		    However, bees don't care. They can fly and these specific ones here also like jazz. <br>
		    Your cursor is amazing at playing jazz, so lead the bees to their floating hive with your lovely music! <br>
		    Click to move the hive to a new location and get the bees to fly more.
